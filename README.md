1. v0.2506a: obtain FWHM of each peak
2. v0.2506b: Scherrer equation (D = 0.9 lambda / FWHM / cos(theta)) to calculate grain size, strain by FWHM / (4 tan(theta)),
3. v0.2506c: Williamson-Hall method (the size broadening of the XRD peak profile is assumed as a Lorentzian function, whereas strain broadening, as Gaussian function)
4. v0.2506d: Halder-Wagner method (assumption that peak broadening is a symmetric Voigt function)
